# Developing a Spring Boot Web Application That Can Access Resource-Server Protected by Azure Active Directory

## What You Need

- [An Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or later
- Maven
- You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
    - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

## Provision Azure Resources Required to Run This Sample

### Authenticate Using the Azure CLI
Terraform must authenticate to Azure to create infrastructure.

In your terminal, use the Azure CLI tool to setup your account permissions locally.

```shell
az login --tenant  [your-tenant] --allow-no-subscriptions
```

Your browser window will open and you will be prompted to enter your Azure login credentials. After successful authentication, your terminal will display your subscription information. You do not need to save this output as it is saved in your system for Terraform to use.

```shell
You have logged in. Now let us find all the subscriptions to which you have access...

[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "home-Tenant-Id",
    "id": "subscription-id",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Subscription-Name",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "0envbwi39-TenantId",
    "user": {
      "name": "your-username@domain.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

### Provision the Resources

After login Azure CLI with your account, now you can use the terraform script to create Azure Resources.

#### Run with Bash

```shell
# Into the directory of client-access-resource-server
# Initialize your Terraform configuration
terraform -chdir=./terraform init

# Apply your Terraform Configuration
terraform -chdir=./terraform apply -auto-approve

```

It may take a few minutes to run the script. After successful running, you will see prompt information like below:

```shell
...
Apply complete! Resources: * added, * changed, * destroyed.

```

You can go to [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) in your web browser to check the resources you created.

### Export Output to Your Local Environment
Running the command below to export environment values:

#### Run with Bash

```shell
source ./terraform/setup_env.sh
```

## Run Locally

In your current terminal, run `source run_all.sh`.

```shell
source run_all.sh
```

## Verify This Sample


## Clean Up Resources
After running the sample, if you don't want to run the sample, remember to destroy the Azure resources you created to avoid unnecessary billing.

The terraform destroy command terminates resources managed by your Terraform project.   
To destroy the resources you created.

#### Run with Bash

```shell
terraform -chdir=./terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
