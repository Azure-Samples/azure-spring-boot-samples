# Feature Management Sample shared library for Java

This sample describes how to use [spring-cloud-feature-management](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/azure-spring-boot_3.6.0/sdk/appconfiguration/spring-cloud-azure-feature-management/README.md) to manage features and how to get configurations from App Configuration Service to Spring Environment.

## Key concepts
## Getting started



### How to run without App Configuration Service
Start the application and check the resulting console output to check the returned value.

1. Load features from application.yml
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. Check the returned value. The feature `Beta` has one filter `Random` which defines the Beta feature will be activated randomly with some chance value. You should see the following information displayed: **RUNNING : application** or **RUNNING : beta**.

### More details

Please refer to this [README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/azure-spring-boot_3.6.0/sdk/appconfiguration/spring-cloud-starter-azure-appconfiguration-config/README.md) about more usage details.
