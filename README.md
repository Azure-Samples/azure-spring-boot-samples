# Spring Cloud Azure Samples
- This is a sample project for demonstration purposes.   
- The project demonstrates how to use [Spring Cloud Azure](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/current/reference/html/index.html) to develop applications.    
- The sample project contains 42 samples, and it still grows.    
- These samples are grouped by Azure services and [Spring Cloud Azure libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/spring).    

    > For example: [Use Spring Integration with single Azure Service Bus namespace](servicebus/spring-cloud-azure-starter-integration-servicebus/single-namespace), it located in the path `/servicebus/spring-cloud-azure-starter-integration-servicebus`.
    >
    >  **servicebus**: The Azure service that the sample integrated with.
    >
    > **spring-cloud-azure-starter-integration-servicebus**: The dependency that the sample depends on.

- The main branch is using the latest stable version of Spring Cloud Azure libraries. If you want to use another version, please checkout tag according to your required version.

## Running Samples With Terraform
With [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts and [DefaultAzureCredential](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/current/reference/html/index.html#defaultazurecredential), most samples in the project can be run with the same 4 steps below:

```shell
# Step1 Initialize Terraform
terraform -chdir=./terraform init

# Step2 Apply your Terraform Configuration
terraform -chdir=./terraform apply -auto-approve

# Step3 Export Environment Valuables
source ./terraform/setup_env.sh

# Step4 Run With Maven
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
It supports both Bash environment and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) environment.   
Please refer to [README.md](servicebus/spring-cloud-azure-starter-integration-servicebus/single-namespace/README.md) under each sample for detailed information.

### Run Samples Based On Spring Native
Two Maven profiles have been defined in this project to support compiling Spring applications to native executables: `buildpack` and `native`. The `buildpack` profile will use [Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks) and the `native` profile will use [Native Build Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-native-build-tools). Please follow the [storage-blob-native sample](spring-native/storage-blob-native) for more details.
