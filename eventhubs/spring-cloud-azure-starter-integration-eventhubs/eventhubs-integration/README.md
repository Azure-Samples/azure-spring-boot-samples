# Spring Cloud Azure Starter Integration for Event Hubs Code Sample shared library for Java

## Key concepts

This sample demonstrates how to use `Spring Integration` for `Azure
Event Hubs`.


## Getting started

Running this sample will be charged by Azure. You can check the usage and bill at
[this link][azure-account].


### Create Azure resources

1. Create [Azure Event Hubs][create-event-hubs].
    After creating the Azure Event Hubs, you
    can create your own Consumer Group or use the default "$Default" Consumer Group.

2. Create [Azure Storage][create-azure-storage] for checkpoint use.

### Configuration credential options

We have several ways to config the Spring Integration for Event Hubs. You can choose anyone of them.

>[!Important]
>
>  When using the Restful API to send messages, the **Active profiles** must contain `manual`.
> 
#### Method 1: Connection string based usage

1. Update [application.yaml][application.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          eventhubs:
            connection-string: ${AZURE_EVENTHUBS_CONNECTION_STRING}
            processor:
              checkpoint-store:
                container-name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME}
                account-name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
                account-key: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY}
    ```

1.  Update event hub name and consumer group in
    [ReceiveController][receive-controller] and [SendController][send-controller].

#### Method 2: Service principal based usage

1. Create a service principal for use in by your app. Please follow
    [create service principal from Azure CLI][create-sp-using-azure-cli].

2. Add Role Assignment for Event Hubs. See
    [Service principal for Azure resources with Event Hubs][role-assignment]
    to add role assignment for Event Hubs. Assign `Contributor` role for event hubs.

3. Update [application-sp.yaml][application-sp.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          profile:
            tenant-id: ${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
          credential:
            client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
            client-secret: ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
          eventhubs:
            namespace: ${AZURE_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE}
            processor:
              checkpoint-store:
                container-name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME}
                account-name:  ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
    ```
    > We should specify `spring.profiles.active=sp` to run the Spring Boot application.
    For App Service, please add a configuration entry for this.
#### Method 3: MSI credential based usage

##### Set up managed identity

Please follow [create managed identity][create-managed-identity] to set up managed identity.

##### Add Role Assignment for Event Hubs

1.  See [Managed identities for Azure resources with Event Hubs][role-assignment]
    to add role assignment for Event Hubs. Assign `Contributor` role for managed identity.


##### Update MSI related properties

1.  Update [application-mi.yaml][application-mi.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          credential:
            managed-identity-client-id: ${AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID}
          profile:
            tenant-id: ${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
          eventhubs:
            namespace: ${AZURE_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE}
            processor:
              checkpoint-store:
                container-name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME}
                account-name:  ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
    ```
    > We should specify `spring.profiles.active=mi` to run the Spring Boot application.
    For App Service, please add a configuration entry for this.

##### Redeploy Application

If you update the `spring.cloud.azure.credential.managed-identity-client-id`
property after deploying the app, or update the role assignment for
services, please try to redeploy the app again.

> You can follow
> [Deploy a Spring Boot JAR file to Azure App Service][deploy-spring-boot-application-to-app-service]
> to deploy this application to App Service

## Examples

1. Run the `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

2. Send a POST request

        $ ~~curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages?message=hello~~

3. Verify in your appâ€™s logs that a similar message was posted:

        New message received: 'hello'
        Message 'hello' successfully checkpointed

4. Delete the resources on [Azure Portal][azure-portal] to avoid unexpected charges.
