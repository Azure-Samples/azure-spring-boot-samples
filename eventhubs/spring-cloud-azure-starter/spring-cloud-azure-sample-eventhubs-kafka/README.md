# Spring Cloud Azure Sample Stream Event Hubs Kafka

## Key concepts

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Cloud Azure Starter and Spring Cloud Starter Stream Kafka for Azure Event Hub. The sample app exposes a RESTful API to receive
string message. Then message is sent through Azure Event Hub to a bean `consumer`
which simply logs the message.

## Getting started


Running this sample will be charged by Azure. You can check the usage and bill at
[this link][azure-account].


### Create Azure resources

1. Create a service principal for use in by your app. Please follow 
   [create service principal from Azure CLI][create-sp-using-azure-cli]. 
   The credential is not required since Spring Cloud Azure support https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/identity,
   you only need to log in with az cli / vs code or Intellij Azure Toolkit, then credential information will be left out of properties

3. Create [Azure Event Hubs][create-event-hubs]. 

## Examples

1.  Update
    [application.yaml][application.yaml]
    file
    
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          profile:
            tenant-id: ${SPRING_TENANT_ID}
            subscription-id: ${SPRING_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}
    # This is not required since Spring Cloud Azure support https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/identity
    # you only need to login with az cli / vs code or Intellij Azure Toolkit
    # then credential information will be left out of properties
    #      credential:
    #        client-id: ${SPRING_CLIENT_ID}
    #        client-secret: ${SPRING_CLIENT_SECRET}
          eventhubs:
            namespace: ${EVENTHUB_NAMESPACE_NAME_SAMPLE_EVENTHUBS_KAFKA}
            resource:
              resource-group: ${SPRING_RESOURCE_GROUP}
    
        stream:
          function:
            definition: consume;supply
          bindings:
            consume-in-0:
              destination: sample-eventhubs-kafka
              group: $Default
            supply-out-0:
              destination: sample-eventhubs-kafka
    ```
    > :notes: Please note that currently we do not support the automatic creation of EventHubs namespace resources, but Event hubs Entities is possible.

1.  Run the `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

1.  Send a POST request

        $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages?message=hello

1.  Verify in your appâ€™s logs that a similar message was posted:

    `New message received: hello`

1.  Delete the resources on [Azure Portal][azure-portal] to avoid unexpected charges.

## Troubleshooting

- Meet with  `Creating topics with default partitions/replication factor are only supported in CreateTopicRequest version 4+` error.
  
  ```text
  o.s.c.s.b.k.p.KafkaTopicProvisioner      : Failed to create topics
    org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: Creating topics with default partitions/replication factor are only supported in CreateTopicRequest version 4+. The following topics need values for partitions and replicas
  ```

  When this error is found, add this configuration item `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.replicationFactor`, with the value set to at least 1. For more information, see [Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Binder Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka.html).
