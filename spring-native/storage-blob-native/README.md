# Using Spring Cloud Azure Storage Blob Starter

This code sample demonstrates how to read and write files with the [Spring Resource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#resources) abstraction for Azure Storage using the Spring Cloud Azure storage starter.

## What You Will Build

You will build an application that use Spring Resource abstraction to read and write data with [Azure Storage Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/).

## What You Need

- [An Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [GraalVM 22.0.0 - Java 11](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) for [Buildpacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks-system-requirements) usage
- [Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/) for [Native Build Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-native-image-system-requirements) usage
- Maven
- You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
    - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

## Provision Azure Resources Required to Run This Sample
This sample will create Azure resources using Terraform. If you choose to run it without using Terraform to provision resources, please pay attention to:
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you choose to use a security principal to authenticate and authorize with Azure Active Directory for accessing an Azure resource
> please refer to [Authorize access with Azure AD](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/current/reference/html/index.html#authorize-access-with-azure-active-directory) to make sure the security principal has been granted the sufficient permission to access the Azure resource.

### Authenticate Using the Azure CLI

Terraform must authenticate to Azure to create infrastructure.

In your terminal, use the Azure CLI tool to setup your account permissions locally.

```shell
az login
```

Your browser window will open and you will be prompted to enter your Azure login credentials. After successful authentication, your terminal will display your subscription information. You do not need to save this output as it is saved in your system for Terraform to use.

```shell
You have logged in. Now let us find all the subscriptions to which you have access...

[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "home-Tenant-Id",
    "id": "subscription-id",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Subscription-Name",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "0envbwi39-TenantId",
    "user": {
      "name": "your-username@domain.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

If you have more than one subscription, specify the subscription-id you want to use with command below:
```shell
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
```

### Provision the Resources

After login Azure CLI with your account, now you can use the terraform script to create Azure Resources.

#### Run with Bash

```shell
# In the root directory of the sample
# Initialize your Terraform configuration
terraform -chdir=./terraform init

# Apply your Terraform Configuration
terraform -chdir=./terraform apply -auto-approve

```

#### Run with Native Tools Command Prompt

```shell
# In the root directory of the sample
# Initialize your Terraform configuration
terraform -chdir=terraform init

# Apply your Terraform Configuration
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -auto-approve

```

It may take a few minutes to run the script. After successful running, you will see prompt information like below:

```shell

azurerm_resource_group.main: Creating...
azurerm_resource_group.main: Creation complete after 3s ...
azurerm_storage_account.application: Creating...
azurerm_storage_account.application: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
azurerm_storage_account.application: Creation complete after 39s ...
azurerm_storage_container.application: Creating...
azurerm_storage_container.application: Creation complete after 1s ...
azurerm_role_assignment.storage_blob_contributor: Creating...
azurerm_role_assignment.storage_blob_contributor: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
azurerm_role_assignment.storage_blob_contributor: Creation complete after 26s...

...
Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

```

You can go to [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) in your web browser to check the resources you created.

### Export Output to Your Local Environment

NOTE: If you are building a lightweight container containing a native executable, you can skip this section step.

Running the command below to export environment values:

#### Run with Bash

```shell
source ./terraform/setup_env.sh
```

#### Run with Native Tools Command Prompt

```shell
terraform\setup_env.bat
```

If you want to run the sample in debug mode, you can save the output value.

```shell
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=...
```

## Run Locally

### Run the sample based on Spring Native

There are two main ways to build a Spring Boot native application.

#### Run with Buildpacks

- System Requirements

Docker should be installed, see [System Requirements](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks-system-requirements) for more details.

- Build the native application

NOTE: If you want to build a lightweight container containing a native executable, Please avoid using [DefaultAzureCredential](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/current/reference/html/index.html#defaultazurecredential) for authentication first.

Add the `spring.cloud.azure.storage.blob.account-key` configuration, and replace the relevant values in *application.yml* according to the saved output variable value. You can find these values in the temp file *terraform/terraform.tfstate*, or you can visit the Azure portal to get them.

Run `mvn -Pbuildpack package spring-boot:build-image`, see [Build the native application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_build_the_native_application) for more details.

```shell
mvn -Pbuildpack package spring-boot:build-image
```

- Run the native application

Run `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 storage-blob-native:1.0.0`, see [Run the native application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_run_the_native_application) for more details.
```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 storage-blob-native:1.0.0
```

#### Run with Native Build Tools

- System Requirements

GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed, see [System Requirements](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-native-image-system-requirements) for more details. If using the Windows platform, you need to install `Visual Studio Build Tools`.

- Build the native application

Run `mvn -Pnative -DskipTests package` command using `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`, see [Build the native application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_build_the_native_application_2) for more details.

```shell
mvn -Pnative -DskipTests package
```

- Run the native application

Run `target\storage-blob-native`, see [Run the native application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_run_the_native_application_2) for more details.
```shell
target\storage-blob-native
```

## Verify This Sample

1. Check out the following console log:

   ```text
   StorageApplication data initialization begin ...
   write data to container=blobcontainer, filePath=azure-blob://blobcontainer/fileName-*.txt
   Downloaded data from the azure storage blob resource: data-*
   Uses can get the data content through this address 'curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/blob/fileName-*.txt'.
   StorageApplication data initialization end ...
   ```
   
2. [Optional] Write and read a file.  
    2.1 Send a POST request to update file contents.

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/blob/file1.txt -d "new message" -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
    ```
   
    2.2 Verify by sending a GET request.  
    ```shell
    curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/blob/file1.txt
    ```

3. [Optional] Using AzureStorageBlobProtocolResolver to get Azure Storage Blob resources with file pattern.
    ```shell
    curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/blob
    ```
    
    Verify in app's log that a similar messages was posted:
    ```shell
    1 resources founded with pattern:*.txt
    ```


## Clean Up Resources
After running the sample, if you don't want to run the sample, remember to destroy the Azure resources you created to avoid unnecessary billing.

The terraform destroy command terminates resources managed by your Terraform project.   
To destroy the resources you created.

#### Run with Bash

```shell
terraform -chdir=./terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

#### Run with Native Tools Command Prompt

```shell
terraform -chdir=terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
